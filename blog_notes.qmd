## "Hypothesis Testing in R: Elevating Your Data Analysis Skills"

#### Summary
This article posted in R Bloggers is a general guide to making sure quality content is created from the work done in R. It goes through the recommended steps to ensure data analysis is done scientifically. It also provides general advice on how to make the workload more manageable. The article also highlights that there are several different types of data analysis, and the examples provided from this one are quite basic.

        
#### Takeaways from the Example

* Use fake data to prove your statistical method and analysis is valid.
1. Set up the environment (This example uses the easystats package)

```r
install.packages("easystats")
library(easystats)
```

2. Understand what type of dataset you are working with. This example uses PlantGrowth which is an R dataset.

Here is what some example code would look like:

```r
library(datasets)
data("PlantGrowth")
head(PlantGrowth)
  weight group
1   4.17  ctrl
2   5.58  ctrl
3   5.18  ctrl
4   6.11  ctrl
5   4.50  ctrl
6   4.61  ctrl
summary(PlantGrowth)
     weight       group   
 Min.   :3.590   ctrl:10  
 1st Qu.:4.550   trt1:10  
 Median :5.155   trt2:10  
 Mean   :5.073            
 3rd Qu.:5.530            
 Max.   :6.310  
 ```
 
 3. Formulate the Hypotheses. For this example we are using the null hypothesis. Meaning no significant difference between the two groups.
 
 4. Conducting the Hypothesis Test
 
 Since we are comparing two of the same groups with different weights and testing for null hypothesis we will use the t-test. 
 
 ```r
 result <- t.test(weight ~ group, 
data = PlantGrowth, 
subset = group %in% c("ctrl", "trt1"))
```

5. Reporting Results

This guide uses a report package to provide a detailed interpretation of the results:

```r
report(result)

Effect sizes were labelled following Cohen's (1988) recommendations.

The Welch Two Sample t-test testing the difference of weight by group (mean in group ctrl = 5.03, mean in group trt1 =
4.66) suggests that the effect is positive, statistically not significant, and medium (difference = 0.37, 95% CI [-0.29,
1.03], t(16.52) = 1.19, p = 0.250; Cohen's d = 0.59, 95% CI [-0.41, 1.56])

-------------------------------------------------------

print(result)

Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  weight by group
t = 1.1913, df = 16.524, p-value = 0.2504
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group ctrl and group trt1 is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.2875162  1.0295162
sample estimates:
mean in group ctrl mean in group trt1 
             5.032              4.661 
```

6. Interpreting the Results

Since this is a null hypothesis and we are using the t-test. We will look to see if our p-value is above 0.05 to fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

7. Visualization

The guide recommends using the ggplot package to create graphs. I like this package more and more I see it, however there is also base R graphs on the R graph gallery website. This is the boxplot they used

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x = group, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Plant Growth by Treatment Group",
       x = "Group",
       y = "Weight")
```
